Master - Slave configuration
------------------------------------
==>master:-Dev-server/where the jenkins are installed ,that server is call it as master server
==>slave:- slave server(another Ec2 instance) to reduce the worklode for the dev-server

-->for the master server can have a limited configuration,so at the time of lode increases on the dev- server
-->master server will go down to reduce the downtime of master server we can create the slave-server 
-->instead of running the jobs in master mission, will be running at slave server


==>for the jenkins java is the pre-requisite,for that we are installed the java in the Dev-server
  at the same time we can install the java in the slave mission also

==> we have to create the password for the slave mission


==> We need to establish password less connection between Dev server and Slave machine 
   for that we can go (cd /etc/ssh) ssh directory there we can find the  sshd_config file 
and we can modify that file where password authantication by default no, so we can make that one as yes
                                                       -----------------------------------------------------------
by using the command called  ------->sudo vim sshd_config

after that we can restart the ssh service------->sudo service ssh restart

then after we connect to slave server through dev server by using the command 
ssh ubuntu@private_ip_slave_machine

when we enter the above command in the dev server ,it will ask the password of slave-machine 
** here we are connecting with password,but our requirement is to connect with out password
for that we can genarate the keys in Dev-server(master mission) by using the command 
===>ssh_keygen
**the key what ever we genrated in the master-mission ,those key are copied in to the slave mission
===>{ssh-copy-id ubuntu@private-ip-of slavemachine}
we can copy the key's into the slave mission by making use of command called
 copy the keys to slave server
--------------------------------------------
ssh-copy-id  ubuntu@private_ip_slave_server

when we downlode the jenkins in the master  mission ,autoatically slave.jar file also downloded in the master mission and it is avilable in "jnlpJars/slave.jar".
so we have to downlode that slave.jar file in slave mission also by using the bellow command

Download slave.jar in slave machine
sudo  wget http://172.31.41.7:8080/jnlpJars/slave.jar
                                  -------------------
                                 private ip of master server
   
===========================================================================================

Same version of java should exist.
Master and slave should have password less SSH

Step 1: Create slave machine  , connect to slave

1) Update the apt repository
sudo apt-get update


2)  sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk -y


3) Check the Java Version
java -version

------------------
We need to establish password less connection between Dev server and Slave machine
----------------------

Connect to slave
7) Check you user
$ whoami       (  ubuntu )


8) set password  for  ubuntu  user
syntax: sudo  passwd  <user_name>
Ex:        sudo passwd ubuntu
enter password


$  cd /etc/ssh

$ ls   ( we get list of files )   Look for   sshd_config

To edit sshd_config
$ sudo vim sshd_config

Go to insert mode

) change password authentication to yes

13) Save and quit :wq

14) Restart the service
$ sudo service ssh restart

Lets test the connection
-------------------------------

 15) Connect to the development server  ( Master )

16) connect to slave server through dev server
ssh ubuntu@private_ip_slave_machine

$ ssh ubuntu@172.31.1.107



exit  ( to come back to master )

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


17)  To connect to slave  without password
$ ssh-keygen      ( In master)


18) copy the keys to slave server
ssh-copy-id  ubuntu@private_ip_slave_server
cd 

19) now we are able to connect to the slave user without password
$  ssh ubuntu@172.31.10.176



-------------------

Download slave.jar in slave machine


sudo  wget http://172.31.46.185:8080/jnlpJars/slave.jar



Check the file is download or not
$ ls

check the file permissions
$ ls -l
we want    rwxrw-r--

3) Give execute permissions of this file
sudo chmod u+x slave.jar



4) Create an empty folder which will work like workspace for jenkins to use on the slave machine
$ mkdir workspace
$ cd workspace
$ pwd         ( note the path of the workspace )--    /home/ubuntu/workspace



++++++++++++++++++++++++++++




Creating node in Jenkins
---------------------------

 Open the dashboard of jenkins

manage jenkins --- manage nodes

7) Click on new node ----  node name -  Myslave
		       - select permanent agent

Remote root directory   -/home/ubuntu/workspace
Label - Slave_lab


10) Go to Launch methods
Select------> Launch agent via execution of command on the controller

11) In Launch command
ssh ubuntu@private_ip_of_slave java -jar slave.jar
ssh ubuntu@172.31.8.232 java  -jar   slave.jar


13) Click on save

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Configure job to run on slave
------------------------------

14) Select Testing Job

15) Go to Configure  --> General Tab

17) Check ---->Restrict where this project can be run

18) Enter Label Expression ( Slave_lab)

Apply ---> Save  
Run the job, In console output, we can see the job is executed in slave machine
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
